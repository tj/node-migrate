# Programmatic usage example

This example uses the [node-flat-db](https://github.com/gabrielcsapo/node-flat-db) module to act as a mock database. 
The module returns promises on operations, and will therefore work nicely with the migration module.

First, start out by making sure we are in the correct directory:

```sh
cd ./examples/programmatic/
```

Then, run the example script:

```sh
node ./index.js
```
