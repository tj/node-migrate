# migrate

  Abstract migration framework for node

## Installation

    $ npm install migrate

## Usage

```
Usage: migrate [options] [command]

Options:

   -c, --chdir <path>   change the working directory

Commands:

   down             migrate down
   up               migrate up (the default command)
   create [title]   create a new migration file with optional [title]

```

## Creating Migrations

To create a migration, execute `migrate create` with an optional title. `node-migrate` will create a node module within `./migrations/` which contains the following two exports:

    exports.up = function(next){
      next();
    };

    exports.down = function(next){
      next();
    };

All you have to do is populate these, invoking `next()` when complete, and you are ready to migrate!

For example:

    $ migrate create add-pets
    $ migrate create add-owners

The first call creates `./migrations/000-add-pets.js`, which we can populate:

      var db = require('./db');

      exports.up = function(next){
        db.rpush('pets', 'tobi');
        db.rpush('pets', 'loki');
        db.rpush('pets', 'jane', next);
      };

      exports.down = function(next){
        db.rpop('pets');
        db.rpop('pets', next);
      };

The second creates `./migrations/001-add-owners.js`, which we can populate:

      var db = require('./db');

      exports.up = function(next){
        db.rpush('owners', 'taylor');
        db.rpush('owners', 'tj', next);
      };

      exports.down = function(next){
        db.rpop('owners');
        db.rpop('owners', next);
      };

## Running Migrations

When first running the migrations, all will be executed in sequence.

      $ migrate
      up : migrations/000-add-pets.js
      up : migrations/001-add-jane.js
      up : migrations/002-add-owners.js
      up : migrations/003-coolest-pet.js
      migration : complete

Subsequent attempts will simply output "complete", as they have already been executed in this machine. `node-migrate` knows this because it stores the current state in `./migrations/.migrate` which is typically a file that SCMs like GIT should ignore.

      $ migrate
      migration : complete

If we were to create another migration using `migrate create`, and then execute migrations again, we would execute only those not previously executed:

      $ migrate
      up : migrates/004-coolest-owner.js

You can also run migrations incrementally by specifying a migration.

      $ migrate up 002-coolest-pet.js
      up : migrations/000-add-pets.js
      up : migrations/001-add-jane.js
      up : migrations/002-add-owners.js
      migration : complete

This will run up-migrations upto (and including) `002-coolest-pet.js`. Similarly you can run down-migrations upto (and including) a specific migration, instead of migrating all the way down.

      $ migrate down 001-add-jane.js
      down : migrations/002-add-owners.js
      down : migrations/001-add-jane.js
      migration : complete
