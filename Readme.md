# migrate

  Abstract migration framework for node

## Installation

    $ npm install migrate

## Usage

```
Usage: migrate [options] [command]

Options:

   -c, --chdir <path>      change the working directory
   --state-file <path>     set path to state file (migrations/.migrate)
   --template-file <path>  set path to template file to use for new migrations
   --date-format <format>  set a date format to use for new migration filenames

Commands:

   down   [name]    migrate down till given migration
   up     [name]    migrate up till given migration (the default command)
   create [title]   create a new migration file with optional [title]

```

## Programmatic usage

```javascript
var migrate = require('migrate');
var set = migrate.load('migration/.migrate', 'migration');

set.up(function (err) {
  if (err) throw err;

  console.log('Migration completed');
});
```

## Creating Migrations

To create a migration, execute `migrate create` with an optional title. `node-migrate` will create a node module within `./migrations/` which contains the following two exports:

    exports.up = function(next){
      next();
    };

    exports.down = function(next){
      next();
    };

All you have to do is populate these, invoking `next()` when complete, and you are ready to migrate!

For example:

    $ migrate create add-pets
    $ migrate create add-owners

The first call creates `./migrations/{timestamp in milliseconds}-add-pets.js`, which we can populate:

      var db = require('./db');

      exports.up = function(next){
        db.rpush('pets', 'tobi');
        db.rpush('pets', 'loki');
        db.rpush('pets', 'jane', next);
      };

      exports.down = function(next){
        db.rpop('pets');
        db.rpop('pets');
        db.rpop('pets', next);
      };

The second creates `./migrations/{timestamp in milliseconds}-add-owners.js`, which we can populate:

      var db = require('./db');

      exports.up = function(next){
        db.rpush('owners', 'taylor');
        db.rpush('owners', 'tj', next);
      };

      exports.down = function(next){
        db.rpop('owners');
        db.rpop('owners', next);
      };

### Promise Based Migrations

If you don't want to use thunks in your migrations, you can also create migration functions that
return Promise instances.

To use this feature, make your migration modules export `upAsync` and `downAsync` functions. For example,

      var db = require('./db');

      exports.upAsync = function(){
        return db.rpush('owners', 'taylor')
          .then(function () {
            return db.rpush('owners', 'tj');
          });
      };

      exports.downAsync = function(){
        return db.rpop('owners')
          .then(function () {
            return db.rpop('owners');
          });
      };

### Generator Based Migrations

node-migrate does not natively support using generator functions in your migrations, but since it
supports promise based functions, you can use a library like [co](https://github.com/tj/co) to
easily wrap generators in functions that return promises.

For example:

      var co = require('co');
      var db = require('./db');

      exports.upAsync = co.wrap(function * (){
        yield db.rpush('owners', 'taylor');
        yield db.rpush('owners', 'tj');
      });

      exports.downAsync = co.wrap(function * (){
        yield db.rpop('owners');
        yield db.rpop('owners');
      });

## Running Migrations

When first running the migrations, all will be executed in sequence.

    $ migrate
    up : migrations/1316027432511-add-pets.js
    up : migrations/1316027432512-add-jane.js
    up : migrations/1316027432575-add-owners.js
    up : migrations/1316027433425-coolest-pet.js
    migration : complete

Subsequent attempts will simply output "complete", as they have already been executed in this machine. `node-migrate` knows this because it stores the current state in `./migrations/.migrate` which is typically a file that SCMs like GIT should ignore.

    $ migrate
    migration : complete

If we were to create another migration using `migrate create`, and then execute migrations again, we would execute only those not previously executed:

    $ migrate
    up : migrates/1316027433455-coolest-owner.js

You can also run migrations incrementally by specifying a migration.

    $ migrate up 1316027433425-coolest-pet.js
    up : migrations/1316027432511-add-pets.js
    up : migrations/1316027432512-add-jane.js
    up : migrations/1316027432575-add-owners.js
    up : migrations/1316027433425-coolest-pet.js
    migration : complete

This will run up-migrations upto (and including) `1316027433425-coolest-pet.js`. Similarly you can run down-migrations upto (and including) a specific migration, instead of migrating all the way down.

    $ migrate down 1316027432512-add-jane.js
    down : migrations/1316027432575-add-owners.js
    down : migrations/1316027432512-add-jane.js
    migration : complete

## API

### `migrate.load(stateFile, migrationsDirectory)`

Returns a `Set` populated with migration scripts from the `migrationsDirectory`
and state loaded from `stateFile`.

### `Set.up([migration, ]cb)`

Migrates up to the specified `migration` or, if none is specified, to the latest
migration. Calls the callback `cb`, possibly with an error `err`, when done.

### `Set.down([migration, ]cb)`

Migrates down to the specified `migration` or, if none is specified, to the
first migration. Calls the callback `cb`, possibly with an error `err`, when
done.
